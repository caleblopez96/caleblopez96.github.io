    Question: How can you optimize a website for performance?
    
    Answer: There are several ways to optimize a website for
    performance, including:
    Minifying and compressing files to reduce the size of the page
    and speed up loading times.
    Using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute content
    closer to users and reduce latency.
    Using caching techniques to store frequently used resources
    locally, reducing the amount of data that needs to be
    transferred.
    Optimizing images and videos to reduce their file sizes. 
    Using lazy loading to defer loading of non-critical resources
    until they are needed.

/* 
    Question: Explain the difference between var, let, and const.

    Answer: var is function scoped, let and const are block
    scoped. var can be re-declared and re-assigned within its
    scope, while const cannot be re-assigned but its properties
    can be changed. let can be re-assigned and changed within its
    scope.

/*
    Question: What is closure in JavaScript and how does it work?

    Answer: Closure is a feature in JavaScript where a function
    has access to its outer scope even after the outer function
    has returned. A closure is created when a function is defined
    inside another function and retains access to its outer
    function's variables.

/*
    Question: How you declare functions?

    Answer: Functions can be declared by using the following:
    Function keyword --> function funcName() {}
    Function expression --> const myFunction = function() {}
    Arrow key --> const myFunction = () => {}

/*
    Question: Describe the event loop in Javascript and its role
    in handling asynchronus code?

    Answer: The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that
    handles the execution of code and manages the callback queue.
    It processes the messages or events in the queue and executes
    the corresponding code. The event loop helps handle the
    execution of asynchronous code.

/*
    Question: How do you manipulate the Document Object Model 
    (DOM)

    Answer: The Document Object Model (DOM) can be manipulated
    using JavaScript through its API, which provides methods and 
    properties to access and modify HTML elements and their 
    content.

/*
    Question: How do you manipulate the Document Object Model 
    (DOM)

    Answer: Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable
    and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope,
    regardless of where they are declared in the code. 
    This means that variables declared with var can be used before
    they are declared, while variables declared with let and const
    are not hoisted..

/*
    Question: How do you handle errors and exceptions in JavaScript?

    Answer: Errors and exceptions can be handled in JavaScript
    using try-catch statements. The code that might throw an error
    is put inside a try block, and the catch block is used to
    handle the error. The catch block takes an error object as an
    argument, which provides information about the error that was thrown.

/*
    Question: Can you explain the difference between synchronous
    and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

    Answer: Synchronous code is executed in a blocking manner,
    meaning that the next line of code will not be executed until
    the current line of code has finished executing. Asynchronous
    code, on the other hand, does not block the execution of the
    rest of the code and allows multiple events to be processed
    simultaneously.

/*
    Question: What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

    Answer: null is a value that represents the intentional 
    absence of any object value, while undefined is a value that
    indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been 
    assigned a value.

/*
    Question: Can you explain how prototype-based inheritance
    works in JavaScript?

    Answer: Prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript is a way of
    sharing properties and methods among objects without the need
    for a class. In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and
    methods from other objects through their prototypes. 
    This means that an object can inherit properties and methods
    from its prototype, which can in turn inherit properties and
    methods from its own prototype, and so on.
