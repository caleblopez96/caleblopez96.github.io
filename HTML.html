    Question: How can you ensure accessibility in web development?

    Answer: To ensure accessibility in web development, you can
    follow these best practices:
    Use semantic HTML elements to clearly define the structure and
    content of a web page.
    Provide alternative text for images and other non-text
    content, allowing assistive technologies to better understand
    the content of a web page.
    Ensure that all functionality is available using only a
    keyboard, as some users may not be able to use a mouse.
    Provide clear and descriptive headings, links, and labels to
    help users understand the structure of a web page.
    Use proper color contrast to ensure that all content is 
    readable for users with color blindness or visual impairments.
